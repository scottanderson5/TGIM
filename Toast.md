# Toast App
**Good:**
  - Multiple options for collecting guest info which can be used to track their rewards as well as send out marketing materials.
  - Guests are given an individual loyalty number, so they do not have to give out their phone number and email if they do not wish to do so.
  - Has internal, customizable loyalty options.
  - Has a very easy and linear checkout method for the guests, which not only provides them many options for receiving their receipt, but also always affords them the opportunity to sign up for the rewards program. 
 

**Bad:**
 - Gives the guests the option to print the receipt. Which is fine, but would be difficult and somewhat akward to have to go get somehwere else when the guest is checking our completely on the tablet at the table or the counter.
 - Main dahsboard feature for the admin and servers is a little cluttered and could use a more simplistic layout. 
 - Have to use tablet to checkout and for loyalty program to be effective. Seems like a limited option.
