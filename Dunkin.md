# Dunkin Donuts App
**Good:**
  - Nice, appealing layout.
  - The app is pretty easy to navigate. 
  - You can get an automatic reward just for registering.
  - You receive new offers throughout the app often.
  - There are fun phrases throughout (ex. "Hold on to your sprinkles").
  - There are good pics on the individual menu items.
  - Can clearly see what is supposed to be clickable and what is not.

**Bad:**
 - You have to register a card to get certain rewards. Really, you have to register your card to get the rewards worth getting.
 - Some of the offers, which are gained without registering a card, are weak.
 - Cannot automatically see any current loyalty points or tier status.
 - A lot of links and a lot of information. the pop-out menu side bar has a lot of categories once it appears.
