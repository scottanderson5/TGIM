# Challenges
 - Not an actual restaurant. Would be great to visit in person and see what features stand out and what the atmosphere is like.
 -  Ideally I would have preferred to interview actual clients of the restaurant and people in the community about features they would want in a loyalty program. Because this was fictionalized, I relied on internet research.
