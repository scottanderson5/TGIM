# Starbucks App
**Good:**
  - Easy to see point balance after logging in.
  - It is also easy to see how many stars you need to acquire before you can reach the next tier status. 
  - Offers are clearly laid out on the home screen, and seen while scrolling down.
  - They provide a good explanation of rewards you receive at your current tier and how the overall program works.
 

**Bad:**
 - While the description of star points and the overall explanation is good, finding said information is hard and cumbersome for the user.
 - It is difficult to know to swipe down to clear certain elements on pages in order to simply return to the home screen.
