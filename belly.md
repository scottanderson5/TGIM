# Belly App
**Good:**
  - Offers very customizable rewards. (ex. Smash a cupcake in the owners face?)
  - Good layout and hierarchy for seeing what rewards are available, and which ones are now available for the user to choose. 
  - Has options for the the user to check in on social media, which the app can trace and notice, and reward the user additional bonus reward points.
  - Connects with the "control center" portion of the app, which is where the administrators log on to track everything. It is laid out very well, allowing owners and managers the ability to see demographics of how many people are visiting the restaurant and how the loyalty program is performing overall.
 

**Bad:**
 - Is a universal app which can be used for a variety or places. Not many of them are restaurants, at least in Dallas.
 - You have to individually sign up for each place in the app for rewards. You can't do just one big sign up through the app which is good for all the places they represent.
 - Have to use tablet to checkout and for loyalty program to be effective. Seems like a limited option.
