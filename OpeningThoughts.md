# Opening Thoughts and Ideas
 - The restaurant is close to college, many of the patrons are most likely college aged kids, 18-22 and recent grads. Millennials. Not the sole customers, but likely the majority.
 - Loyalty rewards helps build meaningful relationships.
 - Restaurant could track customer loyalty with phone numbers instead of credit cards. Mobile app would be updated with customer information stored in the POS system. Hosts/Hostesses check them in when they arrive with their phone number into the POS? This can track how much they spend, perhaps.
 - Three parts for this to function, the Admins, servers and the customers. They have to be involved, and the POS has to track. Cannot design one without the other and have the exerience make sense.
