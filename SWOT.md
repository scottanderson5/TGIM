# SWOT

**Strengths:**
 - Central, downtoen location which is close to a good amount of people and clients.
 - Close to the college campus, which has a wide varitey of people who could potentially be cients if they aren't already.
 - Family owned and operated, which provides a more personalized touch to the service they provide their customers.
 - Has been there for a time, at least longer than the other new restaurant which have recently come into the area. There has to be some degree of name recognition for TGIM in the community.
 - Potential for many new customers as new students are always enrolling at the university.

**Weaknesses:**
 - Students are also frequently graduating and may not remain in the area once they graduate. They could return to their original home or move to a new city all together.
 - Current POS system does not track the loyalty of the customers.
 - Sales have recenlty been on the decline.

**Opportunities:**
 - Loyalty program could attract new customers and provide more chances to keep exisiting ones.
 - The close location of the restaurant to the school could provide chances for partnerships with the school (ex. game ticket giveaways, graduation specials, fundraisers, etc.)
 - Athletics at the univeristy could be, in some way, represented at the restaurant. Maybe in the rewards customers could receive or even the names of the meals.
 - Since "Monday" is in the name, it could be fun to run special promotions on Mondays.

**Threats:**
 - Other, new, restaurants are appearing in the area. 
 - If sales keep declining, the restaurant may have to close.
 - Restaurant is planning on rolling out a brand new loyalty program. There will be a learning curve. Not only for the administrators and staff, but for the community as well.
